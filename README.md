ðŸš€ Tasks Overview
Task 1: Blinking LED on ESP32
ðŸ“Œ Description:
Control an LED to blink at regular intervals using ESP32. This involves setting up the ESP32 with the Arduino IDE, wiring an LED through a 330-ohm resistor, and programming it to turn on and off repeatedly.

ðŸ”§ Requirements:

ESP32, LED, 330-ohm resistor, Breadboard, Jumper wires

Task 2: Fading LED on ESP32
ðŸ“Œ Description:
Use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to gradually change the brightness of an LED using ESP32.

ðŸ”§ Requirements:

ESP32, LED, 330-ohm resistor, Breadboard, Jumper wires

Task 3: Push Button Controlled LED on ESP32
ðŸ“Œ Description:
Use a push button to control an LED. The LED will turn ON when the button is pressed and OFF when released.

ðŸ”§ Requirements:

ESP32, LED, Push button, 330-ohm resistor, 10k-ohm resistor, Breadboard, Jumper wires

Task 4: LDR Light Sensor Controlled LED on ESP32
ðŸ“Œ Description:
Use an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect ambient light levels and turn on an LED when it gets dark. The circuit includes an LDR with a voltage divider, connected to ESP32 for light-based automation.

ðŸ”§ Requirements:

ESP32, LED, LDR, 330-ohm resistor, 10k-ohm resistor, Breadboard, Jumper wires
